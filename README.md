# GSOC2022 with Open Genome Informatics

This is my GSOC2022 [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/0VT60ELS) where I contributed to the Reactome archive of Open Genome Informatics. 




## Project Description

In Reactome, once the new data is released, preceding data will be archived in an AWS S3 bucket. They didn't have a web interface for users to request and download previous versions of archived data.

## Contribution

- Discuss and added suggestions to the mock UIs
- Implemented the UIs using Angular framework
- Implemented a dummy [REST-API](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ECFLzHVb0hUYg7nAbULpZ6EkupJWf0qi/view?usp=sharing) to test the UI in local environment

## Development server

Run `npm install` and `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
